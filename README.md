# Comparison of the Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(SNE) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbourhood Embedding (t-SNE). 

### Imports: 
The flowing libraries are used in this project: 
- numpy
- sklearn
- seaborn
- ipywidgets
- pickle
- matplotlib
- time 
In addition, we have the following import: 
- from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

### Content: 
This repository contains the following items: 
#### PDFs:
- Report.pdf: The report. 
#### Python files: 
- main.py 
- helpers.py
- pickle_functions.py
- plot_functions.py
- plot_mnist.py
\nTo run main.py, please do the following steps: 
	1. Install requirements
	2. Make sure that you have all files belonging to the original Zip file in their original place. 
	3. Run main.py from its original place
	4. You must exit a plot-window before pressing enter in the terminal for it to work properly :)
